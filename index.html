            I began learning to code as a hobby while travelling after completing my Undergraduate degree. After several months I applied for an opportunity in the Grow with Google Developer Scholarship Program, and in January 2018 I was accepted into the challenge course. At the time I saw the program as a chance to change careers and apply a new interest of mine to my professional work. That all changed for me once I began refining my projects after I was accepted into the second phase of the scholarship and offered a position in the full Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.
          </p>
          <p>
            I became passionate about programming after uploading my first few projects on Github Pages. Getting feedback on the issues faced by users on mobile browsers and others using HDPI displays, drove me to find and repair problems I hadn't seen in my own testing during development. These responses changed how I developed my next projects and taught me not only to better test my code but to empathize with my users. I always enjoyed the process of quickly learning and implementing a new skill. The ability to create, refine, distribute, learn from feedback, and improve my work while having it reach people all over the world, almost immediately, is what captured my imagination and opened my eyes to why Front End Web Development in particular could be so rewarding.
          </P>
          <p>
            Working in healthcare I enjoyed the fast-paced, detail oriented, multidisciplinary, nature of the work but my ability to provide support was often limited to who came in to our pharmacy. With web development I could have an idea, design a proof of concept, and share it with almost anyone for feedback in just a few hours. Knowing my work could have impact not just to those I knew directly or even those I originally intended but potentially anyone with internet access and a relatively modern web browser is both intimidating and inspiring. That more than anything else is what drives me.
